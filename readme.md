This library creates dynamic generative headers throughout the Creative Week website.

Simply add the attribute `generative` to any header or paragraph in order to give it the Creative Week 2024 generative style.

For display headers on color backgrounds, also add the attribute `black` to make the header black.

Remember to use the corresponding stylesheet for other typographic styles!
